# Sponsors-Code-Marathon

This is a Fullstack project that was created for the Sponsorship case study during the code marathon.

The database used for this project was Postgres.

The backend was created using .Net core web api and it handles the endpoints that utilize the created database schema. The API covers different aspects of querying and manipulating data across the Matches, , Sponsors, Contracts and Payments tables. The application uses ADO.NET as the DAO technology.

The frontend was created using React. It consumes the data from the .NET 8 Web API endpoints created.
